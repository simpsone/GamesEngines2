Making a space shooter game.

The gane will begin with several different camera angles of the ship moving. After about 30 seconds the user will need to take control of the ship and fend off enemies and avoid asteroids. The levels of enemies will become increasingly difficult. The user will have a lifebar and will lose health if struck by the enemy. The user will also have a fire rate at which they must shoot at.
